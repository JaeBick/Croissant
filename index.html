      <li>
        August Zang, an Austrian artillery officer, is credited with bringing
        the croissant to France when he opened his own Viennese bakery in Paris.
        (Some say it was Marie Antoinette who brought the croissant to France…)
      </li>
      <li>
        The earliest French reference to a croissant he found was among the
        “fantasy or luxury breads” in Payen’s Des substances alimentaires, 1853.

      <li>January 30th is National Croissant Day.</li>

      <li>
        The Croissant started as a luxury product, but by the end of the
